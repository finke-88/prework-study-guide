              <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
              <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
              <li>Color values can be either semantic like blue or grey, or added with a hex color code.<a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/" target="_blank">HTML Color Code website.</a></li>
              <li>You can assign CSS to specific parts of a code with class id's.</li>
              <li>.lesson { } or .title { } are CLASS attributes used in css to change the style of anything with that CLASS. They are always .attribute-name</li>
              <li>#email { } or #github { } are ID tag attributes uesed in css to change only what is tagged with the ID. they are always #attribute-name</li>
              <li>CSS can also be used to select semantic HTML elements like head, section or (p) paragraph </li>
              <li>A period before the { } brakets means this is a universal CSS statment that will affect the whole page until overridden by another more fine tuned CSS attribute such as class or ID.</li>
              <li>The class or ID must be in the line with what you want it to affect, so in the line with head, paragraph or even with list items.</li>
